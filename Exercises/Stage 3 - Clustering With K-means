The k-means algorithm is sensitive to scale. This means we need to be thoughtful about how and whether we rescale our features since we might get very different results depending on our
choices. As a rule of thumb, if the features are already directly comparable (like a test result at different times), then you would not want to rescale. On the other hand, features that
aren't on comparable scales (like height and weight) will usually benefit from rescaling. Sometimes, the choice won't be clear though. In that case, you should try to use common sense,
remembering that features with larger values will be weighted more heavily.

<1st step: Scaling features>
Consider the following sets of features. For each, decide whether:
1} they definitely should be rescaled,
2} they definitely should not be rescaled, or
3} either might be reasonable

Features:
1} Latitude and Longitude of cities in California
2} Lot Area and Living Area of houses in Ames, Iowa
3} Number of Doors and Horsepower of a 1989 model car

Once you've thought about your answers, run the cell below for discussion.

q_1.check()

Correct:
1} No, since rescaling would distort the natural distances described by Latitude and Longitude.
2} Either choice could be reasonable, but because the living area of a home tends to be more valuable per square foot, it would make sense to rescale these features so that lot area
isn't weighted in the clustering out of proportion to its effect on SalePrice, if that is what you were trying to predict.
3} Yes, since these don't have comparable units. Without rescaling, the number of doors in a car (usually 2 or 4) would have negligible weight compared to its horsepower (usually in
the hundreds).

What you should take away from this is that the decision of whether and how to rescale features is rarely automatic -- it will usually depend on some domain knowledge about your data
and what you're trying to predict. Comparing different rescaling schemes through cross-validation can also be helpful (you might like to check out the preprocessing module in scikit-
learn for some of the rescaling methods it offers).

<2nd step: Create a Feature of Cluster Labels>
Creating a k-means clustering with the following parameters:
1} features: LotArea, TotalBsmtSF, FirstFlrSF, SecondFlrSF,GrLivArea
2} number of clusters: 10
3} iterations: 10

This may take a moment to complete.

****************
X = df.copy()
y = X.pop("SalePrice")

# YOUR CODE HERE: Define a list of the features to be used for the clustering
features = [
           "LotArea",
           "TotalBsmtSF",
           "FirstFlrSF",
           "SecondFlrSF",
           "GrLivArea"
           ]

# Standardize
X_scaled = X.loc[:, features]
X_scaled = (X_scaled - X_scaled.mean(axis=0)) / X_scaled.std(axis=0)

# YOUR CODE HERE: Fit the KMeans model to X_scaled and create the cluster labels
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10, n_init=10, random_state=0)
X["Cluster"] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

# Check your answer
q_2.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
q_2.hint()
q_2.solution()

Hint:
Your code should look something like:
X = df.copy()
y = X.pop("SalePrice")

# YOUR CODE HERE: Define a list of the features to be used for the clustering
features = [
    "LotArea",
    ____,
    ____,
    ____,
    ____,
]

# Standardize
X_scaled = X.loc[:, features]
X_scaled = (X_scaled - X_scaled.mean(axis=0)) / X_scaled.std(axis=0)

# YOUR CODE HERE: Fit the KMeans model to X_scaled and create the cluster labels
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=____, n_init=____, random_state=0)
X["Cluster"] = kmeans.fit_predict(____)

Solution:
X = df.copy()
y = X.pop("SalePrice")

features = [
    "LotArea",
    "TotalBsmtSF",
    "FirstFlrSF",
    "SecondFlrSF",
    "GrLivArea",
]

# Standardize
X_scaled = X.loc[:, features]
X_scaled = (X_scaled - X_scaled.mean(axis=0)) / X_scaled.std(axis=0)

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10, n_init=10, random_state=0)
X["Cluster"] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
****************

You can run this cell to see the result of the clustering, if you like.

****************
Xy = X.copy()
Xy["Cluster"] = Xy.Cluster.astype("category")
Xy["SalePrice"] = y
sns.relplot(
    x="value", y="SalePrice", hue="Cluster", col="variable",
    height=4, aspect=1, facet_kws={'sharex': False}, col_wrap=3,
    data=Xy.melt(
        value_vars=features, id_vars=["SalePrice", "Cluster"],
    ),
);

And as before, score_dataset will score your XGBoost model with this new feature added to training data.

The k-means algorithm offers an alternative way of creating features. Instead of labelling each feature with the nearest cluster centroid, it can measure the distance from a point to
all the centroids and return those distances as features.

<3rd step: Cluster-distance features>
Now add the cluster-distance features to your dataset. You can get these distance features by using the fit_transform method of kmeans instead of fit_predict.

****************
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10, n_init=10, random_state=0)

# YOUR CODE HERE: Create the cluster-distance features using `fit_transform`
X_cd = kmeans.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Label features and join to dataset
X_cd = pd.DataFrame(X_cd, columns=[f"Centroid_{i}" for i in range(X_cd.shape[1])])
X = X.join(X_cd)

# Check your answer
q_3.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
q_3.hint()
q_3.solution()

Hint:
Your code should look something like:
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10, n_init=10, random_state=0)

X_cd = kmeans.____(X_scaled)

# Label features and join to dataset
X_cd = pd.DataFrame(X_cd, columns=[f"Centroid_{i}" for i in range(X_cd.shape[1])])
X = X.join(X_cd)

Solution:
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10, n_init=10, random_state=0)

# YOUR CODE HERE: Create the cluster-distance features using `fit_transform`
X_cd = kmeans.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Label features and join to dataset
X_cd = pd.DataFrame(X_cd, columns=[f"Centroid_{i}" for i in range(X_cd.shape[1])])
X = X.join(X_cd)
